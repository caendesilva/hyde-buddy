# Hyde Buddy - Canary Alpha Release

<p class="lead">
Bridging the gap between flatfile content managment and a traditional CMS.
</p>

## About

Hyde Buddy is a psuedo-content management system that is built to be a companion to
developers building sites using [HydePHP](https://hydephp.github.io/).

Buddy is not at all a required software as Hyde is already incredibly simple and easy to use,
however, Buddy will be especially helpful to manage large Hyde sites and will include
features like realtime Markdown editing, and more.

## Usage

Buddy is installed as a Laravel application, and is going to be bundled with an executable
in the future. Buddy must be installed on the same system as your Hyde project, as it is
a local development tool that must be able to communicate with the HydeCLI. 

## Roadmap

* [ ] Add realtime Markdown editing
* [ ] Add form to create blog posts
* [ ] Add configuration options to save and change settings such as site label, HydeRC URI, preferences, etc. Can be stored in a JSON file.
